# super-duper-volcano
This is my custom hotend, featuring three 110W supervolcano heaters for quick heat-up times and thermal mass, and three M3 PT1000 thermistors for measuring temperature across the entire 60mm melt zone. The block is made out of nickel-plated copper, and the heatsink is made of aluminum.

I made this because I wanted to make a new hotend for my Voron, without compromising flow rate. This hotend has one of the largest melt zones ever made, and should be able to push at least 80mm/s^3 of ABS out of a .4mm nozzle. This will require a custom toolhead, which I will be designing later. 

Its done!! Huge thanks to everyone who made this project possible, especially @tortlegod, @ruiqimao, @dr.ooof, and lastly PCBWAY, who sponsored the SLM parts for this project!!!! Video coming soon 👀
