## 11/9/2025 12:11 PM - Researched Parts  

I started this project by researching parts I want to use for this hotend. 

I first looked at different existing hotends, including Tricorn, which uses multiple different heater cartridges to give more surface area for heat transfer, rather than one larger one. Tricorn uses 3x Volcano heaters, which give much more surface area than a supervolcano heater, while staying compact. 

I decided to take inspiration from Tricorn, but give it even more surface area by using the massive 110W heaters from a supervolcano hotend.

These heaters are massive, and a single one would be overkill for most hotends, but this is not most hotends. I will be using three of these. 
  

## 11/9/2025 12:19 PM - Begun Heatblock Design  

I started the design of this with the heat block. It has three 6mm holes for three supervolcano heaters, each with three m3 grubscrews to hold them in. It also has an M6 tapped hole in the center where the nozzle will go, along with a 1.8mm hole through the center where the filament will pass through and melt.

On the other side, it has an M7 tapped hole for the heatbreak mounting, as well as some m2 tapped holes for the bolts that will attach the heatsink to the heater block. Since I like triangles, there are three holes.

## 11/9/2025 12:36 PM - Heatsink Design  

I designed the heatsink in this session. It was fairly simple, just a cylinder with holes for the heatbreak, as well as mounting holes on the top and pass-through holes on the bottom to allow me to tighten the heatsink down to the block. It uses three M2 screws to clamp down on the heatbreak. It has some complex geometry inside, which allows the heatbreak to fit inside, as well as thread in and allow the filament to pass through. It has a hole in the top for the 4mm OD PTFE tube to fit in and push up against the heatbreak. The fins were made using a revolve operation of a sketch I made of each fin.
