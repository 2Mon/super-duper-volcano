## 11/9/2025 - Researched Parts  

I started this project by researching parts I want to use for this hotend. 

I first looked at different existing hotends, including Tricorn, which uses multiple different heater cartridges to give more surface area for heat transfer, rather than one larger one. Tricorn uses 3x Volcano heaters, which give much more surface area than a supervolcano heater, while staying compact. 

I decided to take inspiration from Tricorn, but give it even more surface area by using the massive 110W heaters from a supervolcano hotend.

These heaters are massive, and a single one would be overkill for most hotends, but this is not most hotends. I will be using three of these.
